# Music Player Project
## Overview
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of various data structures and algorithms as part of a data structures and algorithms course. The project centers around a music player application that manages a database of over 10,000 songs sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to showcase the understanding and implementation of custom data structures, including ArrayList, Doubly LinkedList, HashMap, Pair, and Binary Search Tree (BST).
##

## Features
 Custom Data Structures: Implementation of custom data structures without using any in-built Java collections.
* ArrayList: For dynamic array handling.
* Doubly LinkedList: For efficient insertion and deletion operations.
* HashMap: For quick search operations.
* Pair: For handling key-value pairs.
* Binary Search Tree (BST): For efficient sorting and searching.
* GUI: A minimalistic graphical user interface to interact with the music player.
* Song Database: A dataset of over 10,000 songs from Kaggle.
* Playlist Management: Functionality to create, modify, and manage playlists.
* Song Search: Search functionality to find songs by name, artist, or genre.
## 
## Project Structure
### Main Classes and Their Responsibilities
* MusicPlayerGUI: The main class that initializes and manages the GUI components.
* Playlist: A class representing a playlist, managing a list of songs.
* Song: A class representing a song with attributes like name, artist, and genre.
* User: A class to keep logins and registrations in check.
* Music: This class was the prior setting up of the project on console, before the implementation of GUI
> Custom Data Structures
* ArrayList: A dynamic array implementation to store and manage lists of songs and other objects.
* DoublyLinkedList: A linked list implementation allowing efficient insertion and deletion of nodes.
* HashMap: A custom hash map implementation for fast username-password lookup.
* Pair: A simple key-value pair implementation.
* BST: A binary search tree implementation for efficient sorting and retrieval operations.
> Data Source

The project uses a song dataset containing over 10,000 songs sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes various attributes for each song, such as the song name, artist, and genre.
##
### GUI Overview
Due to time constraints, the GUI is kept minimalistic.

## Running the Project
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone
Open the Project: Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Run the Application: Run the MusicPlayerGUI class to start the application.
Or
Run on Console: Run the Music class to run the project on the console. 

[Fix the main methods of both classes before running]
